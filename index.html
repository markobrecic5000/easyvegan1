        <p>The ugly truth is that the factory farming of today’s meat, dairy, and egg industry is down right cruel. The amount of pain and suffering the animals in this industry are going through every minute of every day is devastating.  </p>
        <p>Isn't it strange that it is legal and accepted to treat pigs, chickens, and cows this way, but if someone treated a dog in the same manor it would be animal cruelty with potential jail time?
        <br><br>We have have to ask ourselves can we love animals and eat them?

        <p>Good news! We dont have to be animal lovers to be vegan! </p>
        <p>Abstaining from eating animals and animal byproducts is the single most important contribution you can make to save our planet. Globally, farmed animals contribute significantly more to climate change than transportation! <br><br>The amount of natural resources that are used to raise one cow that will feed just a handful of people is staggering. The vast destruction of our rain forests and pollution of our water supplies due to livestock is detrimental to our earth. Going vegan is one huge way we can do our part to preserve our beautiful planet!.</p>

        <p>Heart disease; leading killer of human kind. Cause?<br>
        High blood pressure, obesity and diabetes, all of which are associated with the consuption of animal products.</p>
        <p>Eating a plant-based diet filled with a variety of vegetables, fruit, seeds, nuts, and legumes can not only help to prevent all kinds of diseases and health conditions, but if you have any, it can actually help reverse many of them! <br><br>It is even widely recommended for people suffering from cancer to adopt a strict vegan diet comprised of tons of raw whole foods. So its never too late to start your dietary make-over! </p>
