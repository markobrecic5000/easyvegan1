        <p>Eating vegan can be expensive, but so can eating meat and dairy! </p>
        <p>Meat is usually the most expensive food item in the store, especially for those that
        steer towards eating organic. Whereas beans, pasta, rice and chopped tomatoes make a number of solid meals, but for a fifth of the price.</p>

        <div class="salad-body">
        <p>What will you eat if you can't eat meat, eggs and dairy? Literally everything else!
        <br><br>Of course it’s important to eat your fruit and vegetables, but this is the case for any diet, whether you eat meat or not. Vegans enjoy treating themselves to creamy pasta, cheesy pizza, burgers, chocolate now and again. Eating a plant-based diet in no way needs to be boring.

 </p>
        <p>For example, did you know that you can use avocados to make brownies?! Or that the water from a can of chickpeas makes a great egg replacer? If anything, being vegan brings you a wider variety of foods to try.</p>

        <h2 class="milk-title">"Don't we need milk for strong bones?"</h2>
        </header>

        <div class="milk-body">
        <p> It is true that milk contains calcium and most of the calcium in our bodies can be found in our bones and if we don’t get enough in our diet, our bodies will take calcium from the bones which can weaken them.

         </p>
        <p>So, obviously, we need calcium in our diets and a good dose of Vitamin D to help absorb it, but milk is not the only source of calcium. Both can be found in abundance in a milky vegan diet.</p>

        <h2 class="vege-title">"Isn't being vegeterian enough?"</h2>
        </header>

        <div class="vege-body">
        <p> As opposed to vegans, who do not consume any animal products, vegetarians only avoid meat. What many people fail to realise is that almost all expensive they get their products from are exploited in the same way, ending up sold and slaughtered for meat.

         </p>

        <p>In the dairy industry, just like male chicks, newborn male calves are
useless to dairy farmers and so they are taken away from their mothers normally
within 24 - 72 hours of birth, some are even shot, killed and discarded immediately. <br><br>
The ones that are not shot will either be raised for veal, or they’ll be sold into the beef
industry and raised for their flesh.

The male calves that are slaughtered for veal are hung upside down and have their
throats slit when they are still babies, the veal industry would not exist if it wasn’t for
the dairy industry.<br><br>

Furthermore, like humans, cows only produce milk when they have given birth so
female cows are forcibly impregnated using a process called artificial insemination in
order to make them pregnant. If the calf is female she will also be taken from her
mother only a few hours after being born.</p>
